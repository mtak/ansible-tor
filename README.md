# Ansible code for TakTor nodes

## Introduction

TakTor is a set of relay/exit nodes on the Tor network. Freedom of speech on the
internet is one of the biggest achievements of our generation. At Tak.io we
believe it should be protected, and currently the best way a small organization
can help in this cause is by donating Tor nodes to the network.

## Contributing

This code is mainly available for reference and transparency. External pull
requests will be considered, but won't have a high priority for the development
team.
